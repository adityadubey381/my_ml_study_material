# 📘 My ML Study Material

Welcome to **My ML Study Material** repository! This repo is a curated collection of my personal notes, code snippets, and essential resources I’ve used while learning **Machine Learning** from scratch. It serves as both a learning journal and a reference guide for anyone starting out or revising key concepts in ML.

## 📚 What's Inside?

This repository includes:

- ✅ **Detailed Theory Notes** on ML topics like:
  - Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees, Random Forest
  - SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
  - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
  - Bias-Variance, Overfitting, Underfitting
  - Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
  
- 🧠 **Python Code Implementations** for each algorithm using:
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

- 📊 **Data Visualization** examples to understand model performance and data distribution.

- 🔗 Useful links to videos, articles, and tutorials that helped me along the way.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I created this repo to:

1. Reinforce my understanding of ML by writing things in my own words.
2. Help other beginners with a structured, beginner-friendly guide.
3. Keep everything organized as I prepare for real-world data science projects.

## 📌 How to Use

- Browse through the folders and open Jupyter Notebooks for interactive learning.
- Clone the repo and experiment with the code.
- Use it as a quick refresher before interviews or exams.
